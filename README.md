# qtile-config
This is my personal daily-driver qtile config.

## Notes
This is not a "professional" config, i.e. some things may be broken, obtuse,
or may not work on your machine. Your Mileage May Vary.

## Dependencies
PowerLine (for the bar), and qtile-extras. I set uxterm as the terminal, you
may want to change that.

## Keybindings
It's mostly the stock keybindings, but I added a few.

-Mod+space: Launch rofi's drun mode with icons

-Mod+t: Toggle if a window is floating

-Mod+shift+p: Launch rofi's run mode
